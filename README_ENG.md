## Project description
We have created the system that recognize queues in different areas of the store in the real time using video stream from surveillance cameras.
Whenever the queue is recognized the system notifies the manager of the store.

## Project relevance
The implemented system will allow to quickly prevent queues by timely opening of additional cash desks, thus reducing the time a buyer spent in the queue.
This will help to create a positive impression of the store and increase the likelihood of clients returning to the store.

## Project goals
Implement the prototype of queue recognition system and people counter using video analytics technologies.
**Planned results:**
1. Working module for store clients recognition
2. Working module for people clustering to identify queue
3. Working module for people counting
4. Determining the achievable recognition quality level in modules 1-3 on corporate data
5. Working module to notify the store administrator about the queue by email or sms

## Software that we used
