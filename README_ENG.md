## Project description
We have created the system that recognize queues in different areas of the store in the real time using video stream from surveillance cameras.
Whenever the queue is recognized the system notifies the manager of the store.

## Project relevance
The implemented system will allow to quickly prevent queues by timely opening of additional cash desks, thus reducing the time a buyer spent in the queue.
This will help to create a positive impression of the store and increase the likelihood of clients returning to the store.
